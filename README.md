# PAM Laboratory Number 1

# Proposed Tasks :

1) Init mobile application on selected platform (Kotlin in my case ). :heavy_check_mark:

2) Create at least 2 screens which transfer data from one screen to another :heavy_check_mark: 

3) Perform some data changes to data you received in screen No. 2 and pass it back to screen No. 1 :heavy_check_mark:

4) Add at least one active element on the screen, ex. button, text field and handle its action. :heavy_check_mark:

5) Change Icon of the app to custom one. :heavy_check_mark:

# Implementation 
This is my first laboratory on this course , so for the beginning I started with familiarization of **Kotlin** programming language .Next, in order to have two screens I started
new activity and named it **Activity2**. To pass data to the second screen the **Intent** was used , which is an abstract description of an operation to be performed . Also I
added buttons to manipulate the data between activities. The design part was performed in the .xml files (**activity_main** and **activity2**) , in order to make the application
more intuitive . For the final step I changed the **Icon** of the application to custom one and chose new **background** and **foreground** images .

# Example of code of where the button is implemented and Intent is used :
